# iSpindel Gravitymon Pill PCB
 A PCB used to build an iSpindel or GravityMon hydrometer that fit into a popular brand Pill casing instead of a PETling container.  
 Compatible with D1 Mini, C3, S2 and S3 mini esp board.

# Building tips
 Use the same components as most iSpindel PCB found online.  
 Remove the pin header plastic on the D1 mini (or equivalent) pins.  
 The D1 Mini need to be soldered as close as possible to the Pill PCB (between 1.5 to 1.9mm spacing between both board; Less is better).  
 The battery holder metal tabs need to be cut slightly to fit on the Pill PCB smaller pads.  
 Follow iSpindle build instructor for most of the other parts.  
 Only install the 470k voltade divider resitor for Esp32 based boards (C3, S2 and S3 mini).  
 The switch lever should be far away from the Pill casing, but might need to be shortened depanding on your switch.

# THIS IS A WIP !!!
 The latest PCB itteration was not produced yet, but should fit in a Pill casing.  
 My initial prototype needed a bit of sanding, will update as soon as first rev is tested.  
 I've only tested with a D1 mini, but the schematic and pcb fit Gravitiymon requirements for C3, S2 and S3 Mini.
